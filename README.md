## Project Overview

The **Mumbai Rainfall Forecasting** project aims to predict rainfall patterns in Mumbai, India, using machine learning techniques. This project is crucial for water resource management, disaster preparedness, and urban planning.

## Dataset

The dataset contains historical weather and rainfall data, including:

- Date and time
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Atmospheric pressure
- Rainfall levels (mm)
- Other meteorological factors

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical and real-time weather data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and handle missing values.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract key features impacting rainfall.
4. **Model Development**: Train machine learning models to predict rainfall levels.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy metrics.
6. **Visualization**: Present insights using graphs and dashboards.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTMs, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Power BI / Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and modeling

## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared Score (RÂ²)**

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mumbai-rainfall-forecasting.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd mumbai-rainfall-forecasting
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On MacOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
   ```
4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run Jupyter Notebook** to execute the model and visualize the results:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Train the model** by running the notebook step-by-step.
3. **Evaluate and visualize results** using built-in graphs and performance metrics.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real-time weather APIs
- Deployment as a web-based rainfall prediction tool
- Incorporation of deep learning models (CNNs, LSTMs)
- More detailed weather parameter analysis for higher accuracy
